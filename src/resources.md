## Tools for running your OpenOakland project


### OpenOakland Project Brief  
The [Project Brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k24P9JiAUEzJLPFRDjVh7aRZexax6NUhfPFLSI3R80M/edit?usp=sharing) is designed to help project teams tackle real needs in the community, ensure impacted voices are reflected in project design, and explore potential unintended consequences. All projects must submit a Project Brief for Steering Committee approval to become an OpenOakland project. For more information, see the [Project Evaluation Pilot Intro](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ivtFcFTtXg33paMLCCMkdxKOZ9hpGVJf/view?usp=sharing) (PDF).
