## Tools for running your OpenOakland project


### OpenOakland Project Brief  
The [Project Brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k24P9JiAUEzJLPFRDjVh7aRZexax6NUhfPFLSI3R80M/edit?usp=sharing) is designed to help project teams tackle real needs in the community, ensure impacted voices are reflected in project design, and explore potential unintended consequences. All projects must submit a Project Brief for Steering Committee approval to become an OpenOakland project. For more information, see the [Project Evaluation Pilot Intro](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ivtFcFTtXg33paMLCCMkdxKOZ9hpGVJf/view?usp=sharing) (PDF).

### The Open Data Handbook  
This [guide](http://opendatahandbook.org/) discusses the legal, social and technical aspects of open data. It can be used by anyone but is especially designed for those seeking to open up data. It discusses why to go open, what open is, and the how to ‘open’ data (author: Open Knowledge International).

### How to Talk to Civic Hackers  
This [book](https://www.gitbook.com/book/mheadd/how-to-talk-to-civic-hackers/details) is meant for public servants and people working inside government who want to connect with innovators and technologists outside of the bureaucracy. It highlights strategies they can use to collaborate with people doing interesting and valuable work that can benefit or support the mission of government. (author: Mark Headd)

### Code for America Brigade Resources  
The [brigade network](https://brigade.codeforamerica.org/) is an incredible resource for knowledge-sharing about brigade-specific issues and civic tech in general. The [Brigade Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16CL9TdmWV0hDY6c85PwtzUcu1VjeSeiDFD2CbtLKf7s/edit?usp=sharing) describes the full suite of network resources.
