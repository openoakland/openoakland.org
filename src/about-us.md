OpenOakland bridges technology and community for a thriving and equitable Oakland. We do this by:

- **Cultivating meaningful relationships.**  
    By partnering with the city and the community we foster a more inclusive, equitable, and engaged Oakland.

- **Inspiring civic engagement.**  
    We co-create tools and events that educate Oaklanders on how the city works and inspires them to effect civic change.

- **Empowering Oaklanders.**  
    We recognize that Oakland has a rich history of activism. We seek to empower all Oaklanders to keep advocating for our community‘s collective well-being.

We're a fiscally-sponsored project of [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/), a 501(c)3 nonprofit. Donations to OpenOakland are tax-deductible and can be [made through Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/donate-to-a-brigade?utm_campaign=Open%20Oakland&utm_source=OpenOakland%20site) (be sure to select OpenOakland from the menu after choosing the amount).

## Current leadership team
The leadership team is elected by membership annually.

### Governance and decision-making

We're governed by a set of [bylaws](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QR-fr1WnmXkZoVNmWnZ9drzfmaZoPkodEOx-PkExt94/) that outline leadership roles, project requirements, decision-making processes, and additional brigade policies.

Formal decision-making is done by the Steering Committee, which meets monthly. Each elected officer has one vote, as does each [active project](/projects/) team. Projects are expected to send a representative to the monthly Steering Committee meetings to exercise their vote. It doesn’t need to be the same person each month, but they should be part of the core team. If a project team doesn't send a rep, they're considered to be abstaining from any vote that month. **All OpenOakland members are welcome to sit in on these meetings.**
