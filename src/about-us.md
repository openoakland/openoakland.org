OpenOakland bridges technology and community for a thriving and equitable Oakland. We do this by:

- **Cultivating meaningful relationships.**  
    By partnering with the City of Oakland and community organizations, we aim to foster a more inclusive, equitable, and engaged Oakland.

- **Inspiring civic engagement.**  
    We co-create tools and events that educate Oaklanders on how their City works and inspire them to effect civic change.

- **Empowering Oaklanders.**  
    We recognize that Oakland has a rich history of activism. We seek to empower all Oaklanders to keep advocating for our communityâ€˜s collective well-being.
