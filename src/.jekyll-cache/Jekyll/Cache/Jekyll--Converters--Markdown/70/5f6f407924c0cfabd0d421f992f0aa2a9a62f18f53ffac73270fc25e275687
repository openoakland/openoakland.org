â€˜Though a lot of jargon is thrown around, some of the people here have no tech backgrounds at all, including AnnaÂ Mathai. â€œI just wanted to know more about Oakland politics and budget,â€ she says. â€œJust about government. And I just find this to be a good forum to, I think, help foster transparency and open government. But also get plugged into whatâ€™s happening where, and whatâ€™s going to happen with the next election, and other initiatives.â€™</p>

But venture out to Oakland City Hall on most Tuesdays nights and youâ€™ll find Open Oakland, a group of self-described â€˜civic hackersâ€™ intent on using government data and technology to create better ways of engaging citizens. â€¦â€™</p>
