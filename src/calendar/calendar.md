## Join us in City Hall

We typically meet in-person on the first Tuesday of the month at 6:30pm in Hearing Room 3 (Oakland City Hall). Over time, we'd like to add virtual meetings as well. [Joining our meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/OpenOakland/events/) is the best way to hear about upcoming events.

We welcome people of all skill levels and disciplines. Normally, we meet in Oakland City Hall ([directions](https://goo.gl/maps/YTNkpZcb7Sy936w88)). If you need accessibility assistance, please email steering@openoakland.org.
