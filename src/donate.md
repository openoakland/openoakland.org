## Your donation provides critical resources
As an all-volunteer brigade, we operate as lean as we can. Your contributions help us create a more efficient, inclsuive volunteer program. Among other things, your generosity helps provide:
- Web hosting and platform support for openoakland.org and other [project sites]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/).
- Supplies for meetings, workshops, and design sessions.
- Speaker honorariums to encourage diverse voices.
- Research and testing supplies and incentives.
- Diet-sensitive food for in-person events to reduce barriers for volunteers from different backgrounds.
- Promotional collateral materials to raise awareness, increase program adoption, and thank our hard-working volunteer contributors.

## Thank you!
