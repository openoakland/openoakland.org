  description: "In 2017, City of Oakland expanded their medical cannabis licensing to include regulation for cultivation and manufacturing. As part of this activity, the City also codified an Equity Licensing Program to address barriers to participation in the industry for members of disenfranchised communities in Oakland. This program includes a provision for \"equity business incubators\" to support new businesses in the industry. Equity businesses in the pipeline will be importantant to regular applicants, because regular licenses will only be issued on a one-to-one basis with equity licenses during the initial phase of the program. The incubator opportunity is intended to help new enterprises overcome the barrier of securing commercial space by incentivizing more established businesses to agree to share their existing space for a minimum of three years. By partnering with an equity business, a regular applicant will be moved to the top of the list for the next available non-equity cannabis business license.

  To support the Equity Licensing Program, OpenOakland provided support to other volunteer technologists and cannabis entrepreneurs working with the City of Oakland’s City Administrator’s Office and the Department of Race and Equity to develop [CannaEquity.org](http://cannaequity.org/), an online \"matchmaking\" application that would assist interested equity and regular applicants to locate each other efficiently. Applicants would create online accounts to pre-screen for compatibility and control the pace of information sharing and relationship building needed for the formation of space-sharing relationships. The app will be maintained until the end of phase one of licensing. This date will be determined by the collection of cannabis tax revenue sufficient to launch the next phase of equity applicant support services (assumed to be within one year)."

Unconferences are not structured up-front; the agenda is completed on the day based on topics the attendees themselves suggest. This gives attendees control over the topics and discussion happening at the event, so residents can drive attention towards issues they think are most important."

Soft-story buildings are multi-unit, wood-frame, residential buildings with a first story that lacks adequate strength or stiffness to prevent leaning or collapse in an earthquake. These buildings pose a safety risk to tenants and occupants, a financial risk to owners, and risk the recovery of the city and region. This data shows the results of a screening program for potential soft-story buildings in Oakland. In 2008 Oakland surveyed its multi-family buildings with five or more units, and in 2009 passed an ordinance that required the owners of these buildings to complete a simple evaluation of the ground floor. This data shows the results of these screenings as of early 2013."

The California Drinking Water project provides user-friendly online queries, charts, and maps to show which water systems have current and persistent drinking water contamination violations. Partnering with the State Water Board and the Community Water Center non-profit organization, Open Oakland volunteers developed a tool features using the State’s bi-monthly Human Right to Water water quality reporting data on cities, communities, schools, and daycares. The online features allow government officials, advocates, researchers, and residents to more easily understand which water systems have contamination problems and identify solutions that support clean water for all Californians. Used daily by local grassroots organizations, the site won awards at two consecutive Water Data Challenges.
