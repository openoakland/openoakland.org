  description: 'CityCamp is an participant-driven "unconference" where city staff and engaged residents can meet and discuss the intersections of technology and local governmentâ€”how innovative technology and data uses can improve civic engagement, increase efficiency and transparency, and connect residents in our city. The agenda is set based on topics the attendees themselves suggest. We are looking to host another CityCamp in the Fall!'
