  description: Every 2 years the city of Oakland releases a budget in a spreadsheet that has nearly 20,000 rows, which does not make for ideal reading. The mission of Open Budget Oakland is to transform this mountain of data into an interactive display of charts and diagrams that is easy and even fun to use. Our MVP is live, but could benefit from improvements, updated content, and new features.

The app was intended to help neighbors report issues and work together with the Oakland City Public Works Agency to remove trash, dead animals, and other consequences of illegal dumping in East Oakland neighborhoods. The goal was for Trash Talk to eventually connect with the City‘s existing tracking app, [SeeClickFix](https://en.seeclickfix.com/oakland) for tracking volunteer time."
