## Status definitions

### <span class="badge badge-{{ page.badges['active'] }}">Active</span>

These projects are actively supported by a core team of OpenOakland volunteers. To contribute or provide feedback, see [Get involved](#get-involved).

### <span class="badge badge-{{ page.badges['incubating'] }}">Incubating</span>

Incubating projects are in the exploratory or start-up phase before becoming an official OpenOakland project. To be listed as an incubating project, ideas must have a draft [project exploration worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k24P9JiAUEzJLPFRDjVh7aRZexax6NUhfPFLSI3R80M/edit?usp=sharing) completed, an acting lead shepherding the idea, and be actively recruiting collaborators. Placement on the website is at the discretion of the Steering Committee.

### <span class="badge badge-{{ page.badges['brigade ops'] }}">Brigade ops</span>

These projects support OpenOakland's operations. Like <span class="badge badge-{{ page.badges['active'] }}">Active</span> and <span class="badge badge-{{ page.badges['incubating'] }}">Incubating</span> projects, they are [open to volunteer contributions](#get-involved).

### <span class="badge badge-{{ page.badges['idle'] }}">Idle</span>

Sometimes projects go quiet when the core team gets too busy or disbands. If you'd like to resume or adapt one of these, submit a [project exploration worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k24P9JiAUEzJLPFRDjVh7aRZexax6NUhfPFLSI3R80M/edit?usp=sharing) at an upcoming Hack Night or in Slack's #oo-steering-committee channel.

### <span class="badge badge-{{ page.badges['delivered'] }}">Delivered</span>

Delivered projects have either reached their intended conclusion or been handed off to a partner for long-term management. Because most of OpenOakland's work is open source, these projects can often be reproduced or adapted by anyone with an interest in doing so.

### <span class="badge badge-{{ page.badges['decommissioned'] }}">Decommissioned</span>

These are projects the Steering Committee has formally reviewed and deemed no longer a good fit for OpenOakland. These projects may not be reinstated without submitting a new [project exploration worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k24P9JiAUEzJLPFRDjVh7aRZexax6NUhfPFLSI3R80M/edit?usp=sharing) that substantively addresses the original reasons for discontinuation. Project briefs that are declined by the Steering Committee twice may not be resubmitted without substantive changes.

## Get involved
There are several ways to contribute to an existing project:

- Join us for our Tuesday [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/OpenOakland/events/) to connect with the project team.
- Join our [Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/openoakland/shared_invite/zt-n4d7tx2t-UVIN7a769e4oc9j7PgM3HA) and introduce yourself in the project's channel listed in the description (see our [OpenOakland Slack Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VWZQ_3ehP5j0IOTY0nJClvQPll3ivSkuAdh5YsOhO_U/edit?usp=sharing) for help).
- Email [steering@openoakland.org](mailto:steering@openoakland.org) with any questions or feedback.


### How to start a new project

If you have a new idea for an OpenOakland project:

1. **Fill out the [project exploration worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k24P9JiAUEzJLPFRDjVh7aRZexax6NUhfPFLSI3R80M/edit?usp=sharing)**. We encourage you to join our [Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/openoakland/shared_invite/zt-n4d7tx2t-UVIN7a769e4oc9j7PgM3HA) and share your draft with our membership, so we can collaborate together as you develop your idea.

2. **Submit your draft brief to the #oo-steering-committee channel** on Slack for formal consideration. Provided your brief is submitted at least two weeks in advance, it will be reviewed at the next Steering Committee meeting (a group of elected leadership and existing project reps), and you'll get some initial feedback and be asked to make adjustments accordingly.

3. **Make any requested adjustments** based on the Steering Committee's feedback and resubmit the final brief.

Once your final brief is submitted, the Steering Committee will hold a formal vote to approve or decline the project.

#### What makes a good project?

We generally consider the following types of projects:

- **Civic tech projects:** providing tools or services to Oaklanders or public agencies to increase access to and understanding of government.
- **Events:** major events that require a team to execute.
- **OpenOakland sustainability projects:** efforts to improve and sustain OpenOakland as an organization.

Projects must demonstrate alignment to OpenOaklandâ€™s mission and values. Some ways a project might do so include:

- Partnering with organizations to serve as domain experts in the needs of the community it serves
- Forming a project team which has lived experience with the issue the project is focused on
- Conducting user research to understand the needs of the community the project serves
